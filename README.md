# Diary Book



My project will help users who are interested in writing and journaling their lives by making the creative process 
easier for them. They could use this app to keep diaries or daily notes anytime and anywhere. Unlike the old form of 
journaling where people always wrote on paper, keeping a diary through an app can be more efficient and easier to
organize, which is what interests me most about this project.

## Phase 4: Task 3

- If I had more time to work on the project, I would focus more on the single responsibility principle and split the 
classes in ui to more classes to improve the cohesiveness of my code. Moreover, I would extract more methods to handle the duplicated 
code and improve the readability.
- In addition to that, I would try to reduce the coupling of the code structure, as now a change in one class will 
possibly require changes in other classes.
